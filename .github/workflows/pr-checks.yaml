  # ----------------------- frontend jobs -----------------------
  # (disclaimer: this comment was generated using an LLM)
  #
  # Frontend build and test jobs are triggered when PR updates frontend/** files.
  #
  # IMPORTANT: These jobs are intentionally duplicated from the separate
  #            `build-frontend.yaml` workflow configuration.
  #
  #            REASON FOR DUPLICATION:
  #            In GitHub Actions, using `uses: ./.github/workflows/build-frontend.yaml`
  #            within this 'PR checks' workflow would initiate a *new, independent workflow run*
  #            of 'build-frontend.yaml'.  Critically, this 'PR checks' workflow would *not*
  #            wait for the completion or failure status of that separate 'build-frontend.yaml' run.
  #
  #            GitHub Actions workflows using `uses` to reference other workflows do *not*
  #            create a parent-child relationship in terms of status reporting for the purpose of
  #            workflow checks on pull requests.  The 'PR checks' workflow would immediately
  #            proceed and likely succeed, regardless of the outcome of the triggered 'build-frontend.yaml'
  #            workflow.
  #
  #            Therefore, to enforce proper PR checks that *wait* for the frontend build and test
  #            processes and *fail* the 'PR checks' workflow if those processes fail, the *steps*
  #            defining the frontend build and test must be directly embedded as jobs within *this*
  #            'PR checks' workflow definition. This ensures they are executed as part of the
  #            'PR checks' workflow run itself, allowing GitHub Actions to correctly track their status
  #            and enforce branch protection policies.
  #
  #            To mitigate code duplication between this 'PR checks' workflow and the separate
  #            'build-frontend.yaml' workflow (intended for pushes to `main`), consider refactoring
  #            the *steps* for building and testing the frontend into reusable components such as:
  #
  #              - Shell scripts (for simpler, script-based steps)
  #              - Composite Actions (for more complex steps or step sequences)
  #
  #            These reusable components can then be called from both this 'PR checks' workflow
  #            and the separate 'build-frontend.yaml' workflow, reducing redundancy and improving
  #            maintainability.
